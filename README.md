# My-Vimrc
Personalising Vim according to needs. 

## Aim
I am trying to build vim according to personal needs. Using vim just as it is, is pretty boring to me. So i have customised it according to me and now it has some of the cool features any modern day text-editor should have. This indeed is a small step towards completely swwitching over to vim but still it lacks may features which would be added as time demands. 

## What's New
In this vimrc i have added some new plugins which make vim more awesome. Considering the fact that pure vim is itself quite powerful, plugins make an altogether different experience for users. These plugins allow autocompletion (YouCompleteMe), an undotree plugin which shows you the history of the file you are editing, and then i have added a plugin to gruvbox which is the coolest theme to use in a text-editor according to me.
Along with this i have added some shortcuts to work on different files simultanoeusly, using split screen and also added shortcuts for accessing directory structure which is quite an important thing if you are working on a project.

## What's next
I am thinking of integrating the terminal with vim. It can be done now using command :term but the problem is that it opens terminal with current direcctory as home and not the working directory.
